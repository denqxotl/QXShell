# QXShell
This is my implementation of quickshell for myself. The code isn't optimized for public usage and has a lot of hardcoded elements at the  moment.
I've never worked with QT, QML before, so the code isn't efficient in anyway and it's pretty bad to use it as reference for your next project. I would suggest to go for quickshell official examples or some really popular quickshell implementations.
